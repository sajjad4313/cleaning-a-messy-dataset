Report on Cleaning Messy Dataset

Introduction:
In this report, we document the process of cleaning a messy dataset. The dataset provided was laden with various issues including null values, unstructured string columns, categorical variables needing separation, and excessive operator signs. Our primary objective was to prepare the dataset for further analysis by addressing these issues effectively.

Data Cleaning:
The initial phase of the data cleaning process involved handling null values and addressing the unstructured nature of string columns. Null values were either imputed or dropped based on the context of each column. String columns were split into multiple columns where necessary to extract relevant information and enhance readability.

Categorical Column Handling:
To tackle the categorical variables, we employed a method of dividing them into separate columns for each category. This approach facilitated better organization and analysis of the categorical data, allowing for more insightful observations to be made.

Operator Signs Handling:
The presence of numerous operator signs within the dataset posed a challenge to data consistency and clarity. To address this issue, we systematically handled all operator signs, ensuring that they were appropriately interpreted or removed as necessary. This step aimed to prevent any misinterpretation of the data and maintain its integrity throughout the cleaning process.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the cleaning process significantly improved the quality and usability of the dataset. By addressing issues such as null values, unstructured string columns, categorical variables, and excessive operator signs, we have prepared the dataset for further analysis with enhanced clarity and reliability. This cleaned dataset is now primed for exploration, modeling, or any other analytical tasks required for deriving valuable insights and making informed decisions.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the steps taken to clean the messy dataset, ensuring that it is now in a more refined and usable state for subsequent analysis.
